storage/warehouses:
player can purchase a warehouse
store cargo in warehouse
withdraw from warehouse
expand warehouse capacity
multiple warehouses


trading rethink:
goods have different min max ranges depending on location
i.e. some goods like grain are cheap in alexandria but expensive in genoa
add a "can_buy" and "can_sell" keys to the goods so not all goods are bought/sold at a city.


ship system rethink:
ships currently are in a dict and are like below:
"Small Caravel": {"cost": 3000, "capacity": 80, "crew": 30, "cannon": 2, "food": 5, "water": 5}
food and water dictate how many sailing days a vessel can travel
crew is required to operate the vessel (can operate at 50 percent)
capacity represents the cargo capacity of the vessel
cost is the cost paid to the shipwright to purchase a vessel
- changes:
    - add ship "hull" as hitpoints
    - cargo capacity and hull hp can be increased slightly for $
    - crew size should dictate sailing times
    - expand food/water capacity of all vessels slightly
    - add names for ships?
    - ability to take more than one ship and form a "fleet"?


weather:
weather random events i.e. storms
damage to ship's hull
loss of some sailors 
blow you off course
delay progress
